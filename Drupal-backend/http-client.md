# HTTP Client #

The HTTP Client provides a simple interface for making **HTTP requests to external services, such as REST APIs,** in a standardized way. It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests by providing an abstraction layer and handles authentication, headers, and other details of the HTTP protocol. It is extensively used in Drupal core and contributed modules to **interact with external services and can also be used by developers to build custom integrations with third-party APIs.**
