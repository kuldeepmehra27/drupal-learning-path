Drupal backend developers need to have strong programming skills in PHP, as well as an understanding of web development concepts such as HTTP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They also need to be familiar with Drupal's module system, database abstraction layer, and other development tools. Overall, Drupal backend development is a critical part of building and maintaining a Drupal website.
